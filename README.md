# nw-window-manager
WIP: NW.js Window Management library

## Ideas

* Create new windows
* Show relations of parent/child windows
* Hide/Show a window another window
* Hide/Show all child windows
* Hide/show all windows
* Close a window remotely
* Close all child windows
* Close all windows
* Communicate with windows created as a new instance (via sockets/ports)
* Keep track of window urls if possible
* Communicate with framework routing libraries maybe? (Like Vue-Router)
